# Climate change Hackathon Setup : 7-9th Feb 2020

## Get an IBMId and IBM Cloud login

Create your IBM ID account on http://ibm.biz/OxAI-2020-hack. Your username is your Oxford University email address ending in ox.ac.uk and a password of your choice. You will need to verify your account through the email your receive in your Inbox.

Your IBM ID can nbe enabled to a large number of facilities - for now you will have had an IBM Cloud instance created for you and linked to your IBM ID.

Login to the https://cloud.ibm.com/login with your IBM ID you just created.

## Introductions
### Introductions to Physical Analytics Integrated Data Repository and Services (PAIRS)

IBM PAIRS (Physical Analytics Integrated Data Repository and Services) GEOSCOPE is a platform, specifically designed for massive geospatial-temporal data (maps, satellite, weather, drone, IoT), query and analytics services. It frees up data scientists, developers from the cumbersome processes that dominate conventional data preparation and provides search-friendly access to a rich, diverse, and growing catalog of continually updated geospatial-temporal information.  See https://www.ibm.com/uk-en/marketplace/geospatial-big-data-analytics

There is both a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to PAIRS as well as a PAIRS API.

### Introduction to The Weather Company (TWC)

### Introduction to Watson Studio

## TWC

### APIs
The full set of TWC APIs is shown here -> https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Ru_3wdMgpbM4aOCm-4qNAnRfjx2w-Ruw3lnr8Hnodk/edit.  To access them you will need an API key - this is supplied to you in the hackathon material.

Some useful information on using TWC APIs is contained in this PDF -> ??? 

## Calling PAIRS and TWC within Watson Studio

We will be using IBM Watson Studio and Jupyter Notebooks to call both PAIRS and TWC APIs for this hackathon.  A great introduction to Watson Studio can be fonnd here -> https://github.com/IBMDeveloperUK/python-pandas-workshop.  Go and follow all the step until you get to "Choose new notebook From URL".  Instead of using the .ipynb file shown, use this one ????? since it has calls to PAIRS and TWC APIs.
