# Climate Change event : 7-9th Feb 2020

## Where the IBM team will be

We will be in the Large Meeting Room (LMR) upstairs in the Foundry.  Please come along to it to ask any questions you may have.  We will also be going round to each team if you have made a specifc request via the Mentor request booking system.

## Important : must do by 8:40pm on Friday 7th Feb

For people who wish to use the PAIRS GUI or PAIRS APIs we need you to have carried out steps 1 to 3 by **8:40pm on Fri 7th Feb 2020** so that we are able to add you to a special access group that has been arranged for this event.  This cannot be carried out on Saturday or Sunday.

## 1. MUST DO : Get an IBM ID and IBM Cloud account

- Go to https://ibm.biz/Bdzwwi and fill in the form using your Oxford University email address ending in **ox.ac.uk** and a password of your choice
- An IBM ID and IBM Cloud account will be automatically provisioned for you.  The IBM ID is your email
- Verify your account through the email you receive in your Inbox
- Login to the https://cloud.ibm.com/login to check that you see the initial Dashboard page -  you will use this account when using Watson Studio

## 2. MUST DO : Register your IBM ID to get access to PAIRS GUI

You must have done step 1 above before doing this step, an active IBM ID is required.

- Go to https://ibmpairs.mybluemix.net/
- **NOTE** we have seen issues in the Safari browser that a blank page is returned the first time you go to this link.  Just Refresh and all should be OK
- Click "Get Started"
- Click "Sign in using IBM ID"
- Enter your IBM ID and then click Continue
- Login with your IBMid password
- Read the Terms and conditions and click "I accept the terms"
- You will be presented with the GUI of PAIRS
- Click the circular symbol to the top right of the screen and check your username is shown
- You are now part of the Trial group

- **VERY IMPORTANT** : Pass on your IBM ID to one of the IBM team (who will be in the Large Meeting Room (LMR) upstairs from 7:55pm) since we have arranged for special access to some datasets that are not usually available.  They will add you to the Oxford Group.  We MUST carry this out by 8:40pm or so on Fri 7th Feb 2020.  We will reply back indicating you have been added and will also send The Weather Company API keys and the Datasets/DataLayers spreadsheet (see below).

## 3. MUST DO : Register your IBM ID to get access to PAIRS APIs

You must have done step 1 above before doing this step, an active IBM ID is required.

In order to allow your IBM ID access to the PAIRS APIs you will need to register your IBM ID.

**NOTE** When you click on the link below you will be asked to fill in your IBM ID and a password.  Do **NOT** enter your IBM ID password in the Password field - put 'pairs' (lowercase, without quotes) instead.

- Use Firefox or Safari browsers and go to https://oxaihack2020.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/api-auth

- At the username/password prompt, enter your IBM ID.  **DO NOT** use your IBM password for password field, just type 'pairs' (lowercase, without quotes). Click OK
- You will see long string of characters returned (example 80889d27-e42a-4e13-8f37-4829659620cc, your text will be different to this example), save the reply to a text editor of your choice
- Refresh your browser to go to the same link and you should get a reply which contains your IBM ID email (example : {"_id":"pairs-**your IBM ID**","_rev":"1-c7a7500961d845a7ce0f8ea8a430295a","token":"80889d27-e42a-4e13-8f37-4829659620cc"}), this confirms you are registered to call the PAIRS APIs initerface
- Save away the reply to a text editor of your choice

## 4. Datasets and DataLayers

We have arranged enhanced access to some Datasets/DataLayers for this event.  Datasets contain one or more DataLayers.  Datasets have an ID number and short names and DataLayers have the same (ID + short names).  We are providing a spreadsheet which decribes the mapping and availability of Datasets vs DataLayers.  We will email this spreadsheet to the technical represenatative who attends the Friday 8-9pm session.

## OVERVIEW

### Architecture

An overview of the architecture is shown below. 

For this event, we have created a PAIRS Proxy to provide more rights than a standard User would be given.  In a normal architecture this Proxy is not present and an end users access rights are controlled by the PAIRS group they are assigned 
to.

### PAIRS

There are two modes for using PAIRS, Graphical User Interface (GUI) and via API calls.  There are "Datasets" and "DataLayers". There is a one to many relationship (a dataset contains one or more datalayers). A CSV file showing the datasets/datalayers will be shared with you during the Event (see Step 2 above).  We recommend you take some time looking at the contents **before** using the GUI and/or APIs to determine if some DataLayers are relevant to your idea.

#### PAIRS GUI

We recomend quickly going through the videos (they are each very short) to become familiar with the interface and then go to the step by step instructions while also looking at the online tutorial :

- There are a few short videos https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0VD16H1q5IO3sP-i667TVyn4OsSP6kPc
- Online PAIRS GUI Tutorial https://pairs.res.ibm.com/tutorial/tutorials/gui/index.html
- Step by step instructions for this event are shown [here](https://github.com/kwiatks/climate-change-setup-oxford/blob/master/README.md#pairs-gui)

#### PAIRS APIs

Documentation for PAIRS APIs.  We recomend quickly going becoming familiar with the APIs and then go to the step by step instructions :

-  Online PAIRS API Tutorial https://pairs.res.ibm.com/tutorial/documentation/api/core_api_v2.html
- Swagger https://pairs.res.ibm.com/manual/api-doc/.  NOTE : you will not be able to use the 'Try it' option in the Swagger website against the API you wish to investigate - contact one of the IBMers if you need to run this feature in the Swagger webpage. You can of course call the APIs when within Watsoon Studio (see below).

- Step by step instructions for this event are shown [here](https://github.com/kwiatks/climate-change-setup-oxford/blob/master/README.md#calling-pairs-and-twc-apis-within-watson-studio)

### TWC

#### APIs
We have arranaged for you to have access to Historic and Forecast APIs.  The full set of TWC APIs is shown [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Ru_3wdMgpbM4aOCm-4qNAnRfjx2w-Ruw3lnr8Hnodk/edit).  The API keys can be obtained from the IBM team at either the 8-9pm event or at any time on Saturday or Sunday.

## DETAILS

### PAIRS GUI

This section shows how to use the PAIRS GUI functionality on a datalayer over Winchester in Hampshire.  It shows how we can use a satellite image to identify an abmormally high value of heat being generated at a specific date in 2019.

Make sure you are logged in

Zoom the map to the Winchester area (north of Southampton in the South of the UK).  Make sure Rectangle is select and click your mouse once (and then let go) on the map to indicate the start of the rectangle and then drag a rectangle similar to what you see below

![](https://github.com/kwiatks/climate-change-setup-oxford/blob/master/images/p-gui-008.png)

Enter the exact date shown below.  You need to click on each date item to change it. **NOTE** : there is a hint on page indicating for what date ranges this datalayer has data for.  This is important since not all datalayers have data for all dates.  We (IBM) asked for specific data to be created to cover IBM Hurlsey which is close to Wiinchester.  Click Next.

![](https://github.com/kwiatks/climate-change-setup-oxford/blob/master/images/p-gui-009.png)

Do not change an item.  Click Next

![](https://github.com/kwiatks/climate-change-setup-oxford/blob/master/images/p-gui-010.png)

Give youe Query a meaningful name so you can remember what it was doing.  Click "Run query"

![](https://github.com/kwiatks/climate-change-setup-oxford/blob/master/images/p-gui-011.png)

In the Query tab your request is shown running.  Time to get a drink or a bite to eat !!  Come back after a few minutes to check on the status

![](https://github.com/kwiatks/climate-change-setup-oxford/blob/master/images/p-gui-012.png)

Once completed your query will be shown in the "Recent Queries" section of the Queries tab/. Click on the image

![](https://github.com/kwiatks/climate-change-setup-oxford/blob/master/images/p-gui-013.png)

You might just be able to see a red dot in the centre of the image.  Zoom in. to take a closer look.  In the below image, we have clicked on the map just to the left of the red dot - a graph is shown of some historic values at this point.  This shows the value of data at this point as defined in the Legend.  Note the value.

![](https://github.com/kwiatks/climate-change-setup-oxford/blob/master/images/p-gui-015.png)

Click on the red area with your mouse and look at the value again - you will see that it is higher then the previous click that was carried out

![](https://github.com/kwiatks/climate-change-setup-oxford/blob/master/images/p-gui-016.png)

Zoom further into the map and change the Opacity so you can see the map a little more clearly

![](https://github.com/kwiatks/climate-change-setup-oxford/blob/master/images/p-gui-018.png)

Click on the image and press the "Download CSV" button

![](https://github.com/kwiatks/climate-change-setup-oxford/blob/master/images/p-gui-022.png)

A CSV file is created with the values of the point for a range of dates

![](https://github.com/kwiatks/climate-change-setup-oxford/blob/master/images/p-gui-023.png)

From the PAIRS GUI there are a range of option when you click the Actions option on the top left of the page

![](https://github.com/kwiatks/climate-change-setup-oxford/blob/master/images/p-gui-019.png)

Click "Download data".  This will download a zip file to your local machine and this can be viewed in applications like QGIS.

![](https://github.com/kwiatks/climate-change-setup-oxford/blob/master/images/p-gui-020.png)

Click on "Developer tools".  This gives the curl command to create exactly the same query you created manually and another curl command to check the query has finished

![](https://github.com/kwiatks/climate-change-setup-oxford/blob/master/images/p-gui-021.png)

## Calling PAIRS and TWC APIs within Watson Studio

We will be using IBM Watson Studio and Jupyter Notebooks to call both PAIRS and TWC APIs for this event.  

We are now going to Import a Project file that contains two Notebooks : 

- Winchester-datalayer-sample : Replicates the same data as shown in the PAIRS GUI steps above
- External-github-pairs-example : A wide range of calls to multiple datalayers

The Project zip file is located [here](https://github.com/kwiatks/climate-change-setup-oxford/blob/master/Sample-climate-change-project-final-v1.zip).  Please click on this link and download it to your local machine and then follow the steps below.
